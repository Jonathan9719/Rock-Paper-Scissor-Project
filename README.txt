Python Chat Server and Client

Files included:
-server.py
- client.py

How to set up:
- First open the server with a command such as 
    'server.py 6789'
    The 6789 must be an open port on your system

- Next open up two versions of the client with a command such as
    'client.py localhost 6789'
    The 6789 is the port number and must match the port number
    that was used to open the server.
    The localhost is the ip address. If running on the same system 
    use localhost. 

- Follow the prompts of the two clients
- Enter a username
- Agree to the connection with the other user
- Enter input with the client that first connected
- Proceed to enter messages having each client talk to eachother
- When done enter 'q' to close client programs
